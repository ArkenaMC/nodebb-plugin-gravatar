# nodebb-plugin-minotar

This is a crude fork of the awesome [nodebb-plugin-gravatar](https://github.com/julianlam/nodebb-plugin-gravatar) but I have removed all the settings pages and stuff and fixed it so it only uses minotar.

Designed for the Arkena Minecraft network forums as we wanted users to have their minecraft avatars as their forum avatars.

Future improvements will be a way to force users to use Minotar. but I am sorta new to NodeBB so have have not tackled setting pages or anything.

This fork is not really designed for production use unless you know what your doing as its not a very good mod if I am being honest.
