This is a crude fork of the awesome [nodebb-plugin-gravatar](https://github.com/julianlam/nodebb-plugin-gravatar) it allows you to use the minotar service to get avatars instead of relying on users to upload or using Gravatar.

Designed for the Arkena Minecraft network forums as we wanted users to have their minecraft avatars as their forum avatars.

This fork while has been tested and proven to be decently stable it is a mod of an awesome so I dont see why it should have any major issues but feel free to report any and I will do my best to resolve it.

To install type this in your nodebb root directory
`npm i nodebb-plugin-minotar`
